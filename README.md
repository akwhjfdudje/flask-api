## Simple Flask API

This is a simple Flask API that retrieves data from a database.

It uses Docker for quick deployment and testing, and uses MongoDB for safe retrieval and management of data.

This project is for learning how to interact with a database on a high-level fidelity and for understanding how Flask and its API can be used to create web applications.
