#Simple Flask API
This is a simple Flask API that retrieves data from a database.
It uses docker for quick deployment and testing, and uses mongodb for safe retrieval and management of data.
This project is mostly for learning how to interact with a database on a high-level fidelity and for understanding how Flask and its API can be used to create web applications.
